Whereas the first human genome took over 10˜years to sequence , now a genome is sequenced approximately once every 10˜minutes . This wealth of information on our genes Š including their variance across populations and rel at ionship to dis e ase Š has l aid b are our st i l l ele - mentary understanding of what each gene does and how they all work together to create a wondrous spectrum of phenotypes 1 . Integrating a deep understanding of the function of genes in normal and disease contexts , and using knowledge of these differences to discover treatments , remains a major challenge in biomedical re s e a rc h 2 . For much of the twentieth century , the speed , scale and control of genet ics in model organisms stood in contrast to the limitations of human population stud - ies , laborious mouse models and genetically imper - turb able c ell cu lture mo dels . Thus , t he dis cover y and development of first RNA interference ( RNAi ) and then CRISPR has generate d t remendous excitement b e caus e these technologies finally enabled facile manipulation of genet ic infor mat ion : the abi lity to p er turb gene f unc - tion and see what happens . Genetic screens , it must be stressed , rely equally on three components Š a pertur- bation , a model and an assay Š and it is important to avoid the temptation of thinking that the excitement around CRISPR as a powerful technology for the pertur- bation diminishes the need to think deeply about the properties of a relevant model system or to carefully opt i m i z e a n appropr i at e ˜a s s ay . In the past de cade , po oled s creens Š that is , the simu lt ane ous test ing of t hous ands of indiv idu a l p er tur - bations in a single batch Š have become an increasingly popular means of conducting genetic screens in mam - ma l ian cel ls 3Œ8 . Be c aus e t he y do not re quire rob ot ics for liquid handling , pooled screens can be executed wit h existing infrastructure by most laboratories that are already performing cell culture ( albeit at a larger scale t han t ypic al exper iments ) and at a re as onable c ost , ena - bling genome - s c a le inter rogat ion . Po ole d s cre ens b e gin with the int ro duc tion of a library of p er tur bations into a population of c ells . Lentiv iruses or other retroviruses are used for this step because they integrate into the genome of the target cells , and thus a cell™s genome is permanently marked by the perturbation it received . All pooled screens then rely on an assay that physically separates cells display ing a phenotype of interest from those that do not . The identities of the perturbations t hat c aus ed t he phenot yp e are deter mine d by retr ie v ing the sequence from genomic DNA by PCR , followed by massively p aral lel sequencing , w hich s er ves to qu ant if y t he abund ance of e ach per tur b at ion . A thought experiment worth performing before embarking on a screening project is to randomly select genes targeted by a library and to then consider the next steps if t hes e were t he top hits . A lt houg h t here mig ht b e s ome wel l - character iz e d genes near t he top of t he list , many hits may b e rel at ively unstudie d , w it h no obv ious link to the phenotype . Indeed , if all the top hits are genes expected to cause the phenotype , then what was learned by doing the screen ? It is a mistake to assume that the identity of the hit genes will shine a light on the fol - low - up path , both because most genes are poorly under - sto o d and b e cause t he annot ate d f unc t ions of genes c an intro duce a confirmation bias . Thus , wel l before b eg in - ning a screen , one should enumerate the steps that will follow : what informative experiments can not be done at the genome scale but can be done once candidates have been identified , regardless of the identity of those candidates ? What techniques and analyses will constitute figures 2 through 7 of the resulting manuscript ?

Am I ready for CRISPR ? A user™s guide to genetic screens John G.˜Doench Abstract | Exciting new technologies are often self-limiting in their rollout , as access to state - of - the-art instrumentation or the need for years of hands - on experience , for better or worse , ensures slow adoption by the community . CRISPR technology , however , presents the opposite dilemma , where the simplicity of the system enabled the parallel development of many applications , improvements and derivatives , and new users are now presented with an almost paralyzing abundance of choices . This Review intends to guide users through the process of applying CRISPR technology to their biological problems of interest , especially in the context of discovering gene function at scale .

The first CRISPR systems characterized in prokaryotes required two RNAs to program the Cas9 protein : a CRISPR RNA ( crRNA ) and a transactivating crRNA ( tracrRNA ) . To simplify the system , these two independent RNAs can instead be merged into a single transcript , the sgRNA , which has practical benefits especially for ease of expression in mammalian cells . t he prosp e c t of hitt ing a favour ite nai l w it h t he CRISPR hammer can be exciting , motivating the start of a project as soon as possible , the genetic screen is often only the first step , and clarity of purpose at the outset can pre - vent intelle ctu al para lysis that may arise after a screen when faced with a long hit list of many potential leads to ˜pu rs u e. This Review aims to guide users through develop - ing , executing and analysing a pooled screen by use of CRISPR technology , including the parameters for selection of an appropriate model system , cell - based assay and library of single-guide RNAs ( sgRNAs ) , while highlighting common pitfalls along the way . I focus on mamma li an systems , but CRISPR te chnolog y has b e en suc cessf u l ly applied to a w ide range of organisms ; a lt hough t he det ai ls may var y , t he pr inciples des cr ib e d here will hold true . Likewise , pooled screens work in complement with other technologies , most notably multiplex oligonucleotide synthesis , lentiviral deliv - ery and massively parallel sequencing . While users do not nee d to b e come exp er ts in any of thes e in order to execute a genetic screen , viewing them as black boxes that do not re quire any understanding of their strengths and weaknesses will almost certainly lead to trouble ; excellent user - oriented reviews are available for t hes e topics 9 Œ 11 . Addit ional ly , CRISPR re agents are now avai l able in ar rayed for mat , enabling scre ens in 96 - wel l plates or 384 - well plates , and much of the advice from small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) - based arrayed screens will apply directly to CRISPR - based arrayed screens 12 , so it is not covered here .

ultimately provide insight that peers in the field consider mean - ingful ? Often it will be the case that the most relevant models Š for example , primary cells , organoids or mice Š wil l b e at odds with practica l considerat ions of sca le and ease of use that tumour - derived cell lines can pro - vide , as genome - scale screens necessarily require tens of millions of cells ( FIG.˜1 ) . One path is thus to use a scalable model for a genome - wide primary screen and then to pursue p otent ia l hit genes in t he more - rele vant mo del . Of course , if the scalable model has only a tenuous relat ion ship to the biology of interest , then a proje ct may be better done by starting with a smaller - scale screen targeting fewer genes in the relevant model . Regardless of scale , confirming the technical suitability of a model for s cre ening often re quires s evera l months of ef fort , often more t ime t han exe c ut ing t he s cre en its elf , but t his invest ment upf ront p ays of f when a me aning f u l hit list emerges . For te chnic a l opt imizat ion , var ious pract ic a l asp e c ts of a pooled screen should be tested in advance ( FIG.˜1a ) . If several different cell types are all equally suitable from the standpoint of relevance , then these optimizations can be performed in parallel in case one or more cell type proves intractable . Even if the primary screen is ulti - mately performed in only one cell type , the conditions for subsequent validation in the other cell types will have b e en est ablishe d , acc elerat ing follow - up . Figure 1 | Maintaining representation in pooled screens . Maintaining adequate representation of the library at all steps of a pooled screen is required for accurate quantification . a | passaging is presented . In the first step of a screen , a library of lentiviruses is added to a population of cells ; the different colours represent different single-guide RNAs ( sgRNAs ) in each viral particle . Pooled screens , especially viability screens , often last several weeks . During each passage , a fraction of the cells is reseeded , and the number that is reseeded determines the representation that is maintained . The remaining cells should be saved rather than discarded . Likewise , at the end of the screen , there will probably be more cells than necessary for maintaining representation , and it is better to save multiple aliquots than a single aliquot in case a sample fails during genomic DNA preparation . Finally , sampling error can also occur after the screen , during PCR from genomic DNA . PCR conditions and genomic DNA quality should be optimized to ensure that each sgRNA integrant serves as a template for amplification and that representation is thus maintained rather than simply increasing the number of PCR cycles to achieve more product from only a fraction of the integrants . b | efficiencies , defined as the percentage of cells that received at least one viral particle , the range of integrants per cell will vary according to a Poisson distribution . c | infection efficiency , so that large numbers of cells are not discarded because they were not infected , while also minimizing the number of cells that receive more than one perturbation , because multiple integrants can add noise to most pooled screens . Thus , 5 % or 95 % infection efficiencies are too low and too high , respectively , whereas an efficiency of 20Œ60 % provides a good balance . d | maintain representation of the library , both during passaging and at the initial infection , is presented . e | of passages and the representation can affect the distribution of the library simply owing to random chance . At a low representation ( 50× ) , the library will become more spread out , with more perturbations falling outside 2 standard deviations ( SD ) of the initial distribution ( vertical dotted lines ) , leading to erroneous interpretation of dropout or enrichment . This source of noise can be greatly mitigated by achieving fold coverage of 500× or greater . f | e , the fraction of the library that falls

outside 2 SD of the initial abundance is plotted as a function of the maintained representation . The horizontal dotted line indicates the fraction of a library that , by the definition of a normal distribution , will fall > 2 SD from the mean .

It is important to determine the proper dose empirically and close in t ime to t he genet ic scre en ; fur t her more , a dr ug c onc ent rat ion shou ld ne ver b e chos en simply by consulting the literature , as laboratory - to - laboratory and t ime - dependent dr if ts in t he prop er ties of a c el l line are common . An alternative approach for selecting infected c el ls is to use f luoresc ent proteins and f low c ytometr y . This requires more hands - on time than drug selection but re quires less t ime in c u lture to achie ve pur it y , w hich may b e esp eci a l ly helpf u l w hen using pr imar y˜cel ls . As t he gene enc o ding C as9 is l arge , deliver ing it on the same lentiviral vector that delivers the sgRNA leads to much lower lentiviral titre , and thus one com - mon screening strategy is to first deliver the gene for Cas9 in advance of the library of sgRNAs , the latter of which can thus be made at high titre . In this approach , it is important to functionally determine Cas9 activity , as differences in expression , protein stability and local - ization could uncouple the Cas9 gene from its selecta - ble marker . Reporter constructs that test Cas9 activity should b e us ed 19 , and if a Cas9 - expressing cel l line is kept in culture for an extended time , activity should be con - firmed period ically .

If maintaining a stable population of Cas9 - ac tive cells proves diff ic ult , one p otent ia l s olution is to s creen w it h a librar y t hat delivers bot h C as9 and t he sgRNA at the same time . As the activity of the sgRNA requires only transient expression of Cas9 to cut DNA , even if Cas9 is subsequently silenc ed , sufficient DNA cutting may have already occurred . Another approach is to generate a sing le - c el l clone of C as9 - expressing c el ls , w hich may b e less prone to dr if t in its p erfor manc e over time , although to do this appropriately , several unique clones should be isolated to ensure t hat stochastic proper - ties that are specific to the selected clone do not confound subsequent biological interpretation of screening results . When delivering the library of sgRNAs for pooled screens , very high infection efficiencies are not desirable , as this would lead to many cells with multiple different sgRNAs , which may lead to nonspecific toxic effects . Based on the Poisson distribution , an infection effi - ciency of 20Œ60 % results in a majority of cells with one integrant ( FIG.˜1b , c ) while also minimizing the number of uninfe c te d c el ls , t hus minimizing t he number of c el ls ne e de d at the st ar t of t he s cre en ( FIG.˜1d ) . A seemingly pedestrian but ultimately critical step in a po ole d scre en is t he isol at ion of genomic DNA . Many commercial kits and homemade protocols are readily avail able , althoug h t here is no one - size - f its - al l s olution because yields and quality will vary across cell types . Furthermore , a genomic DNA preparation method should be assessed with not only standard DNA quan - tification methods such as ultraviolet absorbance or fluor escence with intercalating dyes but also a functional test of PCR performance , as PCR inhibitors , which are miss e d by t hes e qu ant ificat ion met ho ds , may b e at high levels in certain cell types and co - purify with genomic DNA , depending on the purific ation metho d. Bec ause accurate quantification of library abundance requires that each perturbation serves as a template for PCR , simply increasing the number of cycles to overcome p o or PCR ef f icienc y is un helpf u l ( FIG.˜1a ) . In sum , a p ar - ticul ar genomic DNA preparat ion should b e validated in advance before attempting purification of a precious s cre ening˜s ample . Pooled screening assays Viability screens . One of the most basic exp eriments to perform on a model system is to find genes affecting cell fitness . Perturbations that reduce cell fitness will be depleted or wholly absent by the end of the screen ; hence , t hes e s creens are refer re d to as drop out or ne gat ive s ele c - tion screens . Here , screening at a high enough represen- tation to avoid bottlenecks is critical Š that is , depletion via random chance Š and thus tens of millions of cells are needed for executing such screens at the genome scale ( FIG.˜1dŒf ) . Negative selection screens have been used most often in the context of cancer biology in order to iden - tify dependencies of tumour cells that can be traced to a particular mutation , copy number alteration , expression patter n or ot her biomarker 8 , 20Œ26 . Another take on the ne gative s ele ct ion s creen is to combine a genet ic v i abilit y assay with a small molecule that , by itself , does not sub - stantially affect the proliferation of the cells , and thus hit genes are t hos e t hat sensit iz e c el ls to t he sma l l mole cu le . It is important to note the limitations of end point c el l v i abi lit y s cre ens , as t here are many me chanisms for a perturbation to deplete over time . For example , cells w it h a 25 % slower doubling t ime w i ll b e > 90 % deplete d after 3˜weeks in culture in a pooled screen . Although this is a very different mechanism from depletion due to ap optosis , t he disp arate sc enar ios w i l l lo ok simi lar f rom end point analysis . Alternative means to isolate cells that are deplete d by dif ferent me chanisms , w hether by s am - pling at multiple

time points or employing methods to pur ify cells w ith cert ain character istics 2 7 , 28 , can prov ide cle arer dist inct ions , but thes e ass ays ne cess ar i ly involve more hands - on t ime and opt imizat ion . The a lter nat ive to t he negat ive sele c t ion s cre en is t he positive selection screen , in which the cells of interest are those that become enriched over time . Here , the selec - t ive pressure c an b e alter nat ive c u lturing c ondit ions 29 , 30 , small molecules 31Œ34 or infectious agents 35Œ39 , to name a few . The dynamic range of a positive selection screen can be much wider than a negative selection screen , as the majorit y of t he p opu l ation is eliminate d , and t hus the small fraction of perturbations that survive can be enriched by 100 - fold or greater . Additionally , such screens will often yield only a small number of hit genes , and t hus t he fol low - up p at h may b e cle arer by v ir tue of hav ing fe wer choic es . Ult imately , a single s cre en c an prov ide b ot h p osit ive selection phenotypes and negative selection phenotypes . For example , a knockout viability screen in a cancer cell line can identify both the depletion of oncogenes and the enrichment of tumour suppressors . Likewise , inter mediate doses of a small molecule can reveal both resist anc e genes and s ensit izat ion genes 40 . Flow cytometry .

Often , it involves introducing human cancer cells into a mouse model to study their behaviour in complex microenvironments that are difficult to model in cell culture . Mice with an active immune system will recognize foreign cells and clear them out ; thus , such experiments must be performed in immunodeficient mice .

Tens of mil lions of cel ls or more are re quired for genome - wide screens , which will necessarily require hours of sort t ime , and t hus flow rates are par tic ularly important if one wants to conduct a screen without add - ing hours to the required sort time : disassociating cells properly to avoid clumps while also preserving exter - na l epitopes , resuspending c ells at a conc ent ration t hat maximizes speed while avoiding drops with doublets and using an appropriate nozzle size on the sorter are all p arameters t hat shou ld b e examine d wel l in advance of t he ac tu a l genet ic˜scre en . Additionally , the assay should be closely examined as a f unc t ion of t ime : as t he c el ls sit in a tub e wait ing to go on the flow cytometer , do their properties change ? Are they still as viable ? Is the antibody still bound to the epitope , and is the fluorophore still equally bright ? FACS sends cells vigorously through a fluidics system to emerge on the other end in a collection tube ; do the cells start to undergo apoptosis , shredding the genomic DNA t hat c ont ains the s e quenc e of t he s gRNA ? If c el l f ixat ion is required , can the genomic DNA still serve as a tem - plate for PCR ? Variations of these parameters over the span of hours will not be apparent from small - scale tests , and thus specific consideration of the extended time c ours e of t he s or t ing p arameters of t he genet ic s cre en is necessary . Fortunately , these are all questions that can be answere d by st raight for ward exp er iments in advanc e in order to ensure that t he day of FACS proceeds smo oth ly .

The desire to screen for phenotypes in models that better recapitulate the diversity of environ - ments and interact ions bet we en cel l typ es makes in˜v ivo screens , usually in mouse models , particularly attrac - tive 45Œ49 . Here , the determination of representation is far more challenging , as cell numbers can not easily b e moni- tore d in the organism over t ime . For example , supp ose t he go al is to study genes involve d in tumour c ell growt h in a xenograft model . Although 1 million cells may be int ro duc e d into t he mous e , t here is no gu arantee t hat a l l the cells will successfully engraft and contribute to the tumour . As the engraftment efficiency is a function of both the mouse genetic background ( such as the exact combination of mutations to disable its immune system ) and the human tumour cells that are being introduced , the number of cells , and thus the number of pertur- bations , that can successfully be assayed in a reasonable number of mice must be deter mined empiric al ly 50 , 51 . T he s ame consider at ions apply w hen mod i f y i ng endogenous mous e c ells by int ro ducing lent iv irus direc t ly to the ani - mal : it is important to consider the number of relevant cells Š those that pertain to the biological question Š that rec eive the perturb ation ( for example , distinguishing neurons from g li a or tumour from st roma ) .

A lt e rn at ive ly , a pre - existing genome - wide sgRNA library , which is likely to contain far more perturbations than the capacity of the mouse model , can be used by simply treating the sgRNAs as barcodes , with the assumption that for esti - mat ion purp os es , most s gRNAs w i ll have minima l c on - s e quenc es on t he phenot yp e of interest and t hus b ehave as cellular barcodes . In either case , cells are harvested from the mouse , genomic DNA is prepared and the bar - code or sgRNA is amplified . Sequencing can then reveal how many unique sequences are present in the sample and t hus est imate t he number of p er tur bations t hat c an b e ef fec tively s creened . After performing such experiments , it will often be t he c as e t hat genome - w ide s cre ens are not fe asible , and t hus a more fruit fu l st rate gy wil l b e to cre ate smal ler , customized libraries , operating under the premise that it is b etter to get a go o d answer for a smal ler number of genes than a weaker answer for many genes . Certainly , a successful screen with a customized library that validates t he rele vance and prac t ic a lit y of a mo del is an exc ellent motivator for funding and executing additional screens .

For loss - of - function studies , CRISPR - ko c an create t r u ly nu l l a l leles , w hich may b e nec ess ar y for s ome gene products if even residual levels are enough to maintain a phenotype . Conversely , CRISPRi and other repres - sive modalities may be better suited to studying genes that manifest different phenotypes at different gene doses and essential genes that can not tolerate complete knockout or to examining non - coding regions , as dis - cussed below . Finally , RNAi should not be dismissed for cre at ing loss - of - f unc t ion , as it prov ides the abi lit y to t arget mRNA dire c t ly and avoids t he ne ed to c o - deliver the large and exogenous Cas9 protein 76 , although the much higher rate of off - target effects for RNAi than for CRISPR necessitates additional vigilance in valida - t i on 7 7 Œ81 .

Given all these options for Cas9 activities and com - plementary perturbations , the question is not ‚Which one should I use ? ™ but rather ‚Which one should I use first ? ™ .

Cas9 can be used in its unmodified , wild-type form ( wtCas9 ) to cut DNA and create knockouts ( CRISPR - ko ) . After inactivating the nuclease domains to create dead Cas9 ( dCas9 ) , additional domains can be appended to extend the range of activities for CRISPR technology . Transcriptional activation ( CRISPRa ) 62 is achieved by tethering one

or more activating domains ; a recent study compared the efficacy of several approaches 129 . Conversely , dCas9 can be tethered to inhibitory domains to interfere with transcription , known as CRISPRi . Modification of DNA methylation marks is accomplished by DNA ( cytosine - 5 ) -methyltransferase 3A ( DNMT3A ) , which adds methyl groups at CpG sites , and TET methylcytosine dioxygenase ( TET ) removes methylation 130 . Several domains have been shown to enable modification of histone marks 68 , 69 ; a recent review provides additional detail 131 . Finally , fusing a cytidine deaminase domain from DNA dC ˜ dU-editing enzyme APOBEC3 or an activation-induced cytidine deaminase ( AID ) domain to dCas9 allows conversion of DNA bases in the absence of double-strand DNA breaks .

If cel l numbers and the subsequent assay are not limiting , then genome - s c a le scre ens have implicit app e a l , esp e ci a l ly if t he y a l low the use of readily available , premade libraries 22 , 26 , 84Œ86 . Likewise , t he number of s gRNAs per gene can var y . The use of more sgRNAs per gene in a primary screen ( ~8Œ10 ) al lows greater statistical certainty for hits that emerge from a pr imar y scre en , w hich may b e esp e ci al ly helpful for the initial detection of genes with weaker pheno types . Conversely , the use of fewer sgRNAs per gene ( ~2Œ4 ) requires fewer cells and thus , for the same c ost as s cre ening a l arger librar y , enables t he pr imar y screen to be performed in more models . One excellent source for browsing and comparing existing libraries is Addgene , which can also provide either plasmid DNA or , for some librar ies , re ady - to - s cre en lent iv ir us es . When the model or assay dictates the use of a smaller library , choices must be made about which genes to examine . One approach is to use premade genomic subs ets , t arget ing s ets of genes organiz e d around a bio - logical theme , such as kinases , transcription fac tors or mitochondrial proteins 6 , 84 , 87 . A second approach is to use pre v iously generate d d at a to nominate genes of interest , such as differential expression profiling or genome - wide association studies ( GWAS ) , followed by the creation of a c ustomiz ed library , which can be done in - hous e 88 or outsourced to commercial vendors . The creation of custom pools will also be an essential task for those intereste d in less - studie d mo del organisms . Genomic characterization of target genes . Library design requires the curation of genomic data from a number of disparate sources . For premade libraries , that work has already been done , but it is important to understand the choices that were made , both to know the strengths and weaknesses of a particular library and to understand the path for designing a c ustomized librar y. Fur t

her more , librar ies designe d for genera l us e , without prior knowledge of what cell type they will be applied to , must make some simplifying assumptions , whereas customized libraries can more explicitly use genomic charac ter izat ion d at a. Imp or t ant ly , annot at ion of the human genome continues to be dynamic . Changes include recognition of new genes while other genes are reclassified as pseudogenes , inclusion or exclusion of an exon in the representative transcript and redefining minor and major single - nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) , to name a few . Thus , libraries depreciate over t ime , and e ven if a librar y is us e d t hat was desig ne d s e v - eral years ago , using an updated annotation of the target ( or t argets ) of each s gRNA w i ll improve dow nst re am ana ly s is . Targeting protein - coding genes with CRISPR - ko presents an abundance of potential sgRNAs , which must be chosen wisely , as there is wide variability in the efficacy of different sgRNAs ( FIG.˜3a ) , and , as dis - cussed below , consistency of sgRNAs targeting the same gene is the bedrock of screen analysis . Considering the st r uc ture of t he t arget gene is imp or t ant , as c er t ain sites should generally be avoided , including sites upstream of an alternative start codon , sites that overlap with high - frequency SNPs 89 and sites close to the end of the coding region 19 , as these may not produce a phenotype ( FIG.˜ 3b ) . In some cases , targeting conserved protein domains has been helpful , presumably because even in - frame repair products are more likely to be delete - rious 90 , 91 . Additionally , alternative splicing information can be used to target constitutive or transcript - specific exons ; here , the APPRIS database 92 , which is incorpo - rate d into GENC ODE , is p ar t ic ul arly helpf u l. A lt houg h genome - wide libraries generally pick a single represent - at ive trans cript , w hen designing a c ustom librar y , RNA s e quencing of t he sp ecif ic c el l t yp e can b e us e d to t arget the relevant isoforms and may also be used to exclude none x pre ss e d˜ge ne s . The on - target properties of sgRNAs have been the focus of several studies , and it is clear that the primary sequence of the sgRNA and the surrounding target site is a maj or deter minant of its ac tivit y 6 , 19 , 84 , 93 . Wh i l e c om - putational predictions are imperfect , they greatly bias t he us er towards suc c ess ( FIG.˜3c , d ) , and t h e p e r for m an c e of dif ferent pre dict ion a lgor it hms has b e en c omp ared across data sets 94 . Importantly , the relative efficacy of s gRNAs is genera l ly c onc ord ant across c el l lines , and at least part of this concordance is due to the fact that the repair products of NHEJ are consistent across cell lines 95 ; in other words , sgRNAs do not cause a random set of repair products , with one - third in - frame and two - thirds out of frame ; rather , DNA is repaired according to not - yet - understood rules 96 . Thus , sgRNAs can be ident if ie d t hat are bi as e d towards out - of - f rame˜repair . The ability for a perturbation to target sites other t han the intende d one c an c onfound exp er iments , and met ho ds to deter mine t he of f - t arget ac t iv it y of sgRNAs have re cently be en reviewed 97 . C omputat ion al pred ic - tion of off - target sites has improved over time , and different approaches have recently been compared 94 , 98 . There does not appear to be much , if any , relationship between on - target activity and propensity for off - target effects ( FIG.˜3e ) , and thus one can generally select sgRNAs that maximize efficacy while minimizing off - target effects . Most recent design websites provide a numerical score for each of these properties and may a ls o ag g re gate t hem into a single ran k ing to ident if y t he most desirable s gRNAs for a g iven˜gene . For CRISPRa and CRISPR i , t he lo c ation of t he t ran - scription start site ( TSS ) is the most important design c rit e ri on 86 , 99 . Here , us e of the FANTOM d at

Although sequence features of the sgRNA can still play a role in improving activity 84 , 8 7 , 93 , the narrow window of optimal activity Š only ~100 nucleotides Š leads to fewer s gRNAs from which to choose relative to screens using CRISPR - ko . However , this also means that off - target effects may be less of a concer n , as s gRNAs b ound outside t he crit ic a l NATURE REVIEWS | GENETICS VOLUME 19 | FEBRUARY 2018 | 73 ß e  ’  ”  ‘ Ÿ e e e ¦ e e e e ¥ e e e ¥ window are unlikely to have much activity .

Beyond the proteome . The use of the term ‚genome - wide™ to refer to libraries that modulate only pro - tein - coding genes is common but inaccurate , selling short a very large fraction of the human genome , and CRISPR te chnology has show n succ ess in inter rogat ing DNA regulatory regions . Here , because the landscape of potent ia l t argets is b ot h more broad and more c el l - type - sp e cific , gener ic librar ies are not as w idely applic able as t he y are for protein - c o ding genes , and instead , libraries customized to particular regions of interest have been most pro duct ive . B ot h CRISPR i 105 and CRISPR - ko 106 , 107 have been used to occlude or disrupt regulatory ele - ments , respectively , although more direct comparisons w il l b e nee ded to deter mine w hether one approach is consistently more informative . Given that the majority of variation implicated in human disease by GWAS studies fal ls in non - coding regions , these types of screens wil l have broad applicability , although here , the challenge will not be in nominating regions or designing librar - ies but rather in identifying the appropriate cell type in w hich vari ants exer t t heir ef fe c ts . Non - coding RNAs are another class of gene where CRISPR technology has shown promise as a screening technology . These RNAs are poorly targeted by RNAi , at le ast in p ar t b ec ause many of them are rel atively deplete d in the cytoplasm , where the RNAi machinery is active . Furthermore , CRISPR - ko has limited abilit y to perturb non - coding RNAs because small indels may affect func - t ion on ly rarely ( un li ke the f unct iona l cons e quenc es of frameshifts in protein - coding genes ) . Therefore , CRISPRa and CRISPRi technologies are the methods of choice for manipulating the expression of this class of genes . A genome - sca le CRISPRi screen of non - c oding RNAs showed that downregulation of some non - coding RNAs leads to viability effects , which exhibited more cell - type specificity than protein - coding genes 108 . Thus , similar to the choice of different perturbational technologies , the choice of target types Š protein - coding genes , regulatory regions or non - coding transcripts Š is not a question of which one to screen but of which one to screen first in a proven and informative model˜system . Analysis and follow-up From screening data to a hit list . The expertise of biolo- g ists often does not extend to t he c ommand line or advance d statist ics , and when conf ronted with a l arge dat a s et , many quickly run up against the limitat ions of what can be accomplished with Microsoft Excel . Howe ver , go o d prog ress can sti l l b e made wit h minima l computational or mathematical expertise . A suitable approach is to begin by checking replicate correlation to gain an intuit ion of how much te chnic a l vari abi lit y was present in the model and the assay during the screen . Such manual examination of the data is essential in order to identify outlier replicates , sample swaps , mislabelled conditions and other errors that may be lost if all the data are to o quickly dropp e d into an ana lysis p ackage . Next , simple averag ing of t he effe ct of mu lt iple s gRNAs target - ing the same gene can quickly provide a working ‚hit list™ ; if multiple sgRNAs targeting a gene all rank highly , then t hat gene is quite li kely to b e a hit , and literature s e arches can commence to learn about the genes in the hit list and to desig n fol low - up˜steps . For more complete analysis , s everal fairly easy - to - implement desig n packages have be en descr ibe d t hat c an prov ide more dept h of infor mat ion , a lt houg h thes e analyses should not wildly alter the identity of top hit genes compared to those identified in the preliminary analysis 109 Œ 111 . Furthermore , it is important to distinguish unf ami li ar ity with c omputat ional appro aches from dis - interest in the underlying principles of the analysis ; t he former c an b e br idged w it h help from a c ol league , whereas the latter is simply

poor practice , as the respon - sibility for thinking should not be outsourced . The most imp ortant principle for analysis of genetic screening data is to leverage built - in redundancy , that is , the use of multiple sgRNAs targeting a gene . Ultimately , there is a strong cultural desire to produce the ‚hit list™ Š a single , aut hor it at ive ran k ing of genes t hat appe ars as a table in a publication Š but there are multiple ways of p er for ming ana lys es , al l re asonable , and t he many gen - erally equivalent permutations must not be allowed to lead to paralysis .

Following a primary screen , an effective follow - up strategy is to design a custom pool , as used in the screen Box 1 | Validation and analysis workflow The screen by Parnas for regulators of the innate immune response provides an instructive example for the step-wise workflow of a pooled screen in a challenging model system 42 . Here , cell inputs were limiting , as the screen relied on primary cells harvested from mouse bone marrow . These cells were infected with a genome-scale library with 6 single-guide RNAs ( sgRNAs ) per gene for a total size of ~120,000 sgRNAs , stimulated with lipopolysaccharide and then fluorescence-activated cell sorting ( FACS ) was used to isolate cells with high and low levels of intracellular tumour necrosis factor ( TNF ) . During analysis of the screen , sgRNAs that were initially at low abundance in the library were eliminated from consideration , as were a few sgRNAs targeting control genes for which plasmid DNAs , abundant in the laboratory , contaminated the genomic DNA samples ( a good warning that genomic DNA preparation and PCR set - up should be done in a physically distinct location from bacterial

maxi-preps ) . The abundance of sgRNAs in the TNF-low expressing population was subtracted from the TNF-high expressing population . At first glance , this produced discouraging results : pairwise correlations of 0.017 , 0.003 and 0.021 across three biological replicates ( see the figure , part a ) . However , after combining information for sgRNAs targeting the same gene , a signal begins to emerge ( see the figure , part b ) . Notice that the first replicate produced the fewest genes scoring with high statistical significance , whereas the third replicate produced the most ; the use of more cells and additional experience in executing the screen probably led to this performance improvement . A secondary pool was then generated based on genes that scored in the primary screen , with 10 sgRNAs per gene for ~2,500 genes , and the reduction in library size allowed the collection of much cleaner data ; here , pairwise replicate correlations ranged from 0.60 to 0.63 , and the increase in both data quality and the number of sgRNAs per gene led to many hits scoring with very strong statistical significance ( see the figure , part b ) . Comparing the primary to the secondary screen , there is a clear relationship between the statistical strength of the hit in the primary screen and the validation rate in the secondary screen ( see the figure , part c ; the total number of genes that were validated is indicated on top of the bar ) , and it is also clear that the secondary screen enabled clear discrimination between true and false positives from the primary screen ( see the figure , part d ) . Thus , the strategy that Parnas took has proven successful : they immediately began to validate genes that scored strongly on the basis of only primary screening data while in parallel generating a secondary pool that can be used to mine more genes from an assay , especially at a time when the relevant hands - on expertise is still present in the laboratory .

Here , the thought process is that the primary screen is more concerned with identifying p otent ia l hit genes , and us ers can move for ward w it h many genes , even those with marginal phenotypes . In other words , the concern at this stage is less about false positives , as those will be weeded out in the secondary screen , and more about making sure genes that may have scored weakly owing to ineffective perturbations are not left behind as false negatives . In this custom pool for a se c ond ar y s cre en , many more s gRNAs p er gene c an be included , which gives much greater confidence to the resu lt ing answer for e ach gene . Prac tic a lly , by v irtue of being substantially smaller , this custom pool can be scre ened across several cell types and in more - relevant cell types for which screening at the genome scale proved infeasible . For example , if the initial library targeted 20,000 genes with 5 sgRNAs per gene , the secondary pool can be made to target 500 genes with 20 sgRNAs p er gene and st i ll b e tenfold sma l ler . As t he s

gRNA p o ol is being made anew , this step also offers t he opportunity to take into account cell - type - specific genomic informa - tion that may not have been leveraged if a general - use genome - w ide librar y was us e d init i a l ly . Systematic error modes . No te chnology is wit hout its shortcomings and blind spots , and CRISPR is no excep - tion . Although the intended outcome of sgRNAs used with wild - type Cas9 is the creation of loss - of - function alleles , some positive selection screens have identified for tuitous gain - of - f unc tion mutations resulting f rom in - f rame repair 113 , 114 . For tunately , t hes e are rare enoug h to avoid confounding gene - level interpretation , and they can provide useful insight into protein domains when detected . A broader cha llenge for CRISPR - ko screens is that double - strand DNA breaks trigger a c el lu l ar resp onse . If a p ar ticu l ar s gRNA t ru ly c uts the genome twice , once for each copy of the gene , there may not appear to be much of an effect on cellular fitness . However , if the target site is in an amplified region , or the s gRNA is promiscuous and has many off - target sites , the cell will pause in the cell cycle or undergo apop tosis 84 , 85 , 91 , 115 . The resulting dropout may appear to indicate that the target gene is essential for the cell , but the fitness defect is not due to loss of the protein prod - uc t ; rat her , it is due to this mu lt iplicit y - of - c utt ing ef fe ct . Indeed , when this has been examined in detail , such as for the BCRŒABL and AKT oncogenes , CRISPR reagents will erroneously identify many genes in a copy - number - amplified region as essential , whereas RNAi reagents c an c or re c t ly ident if y on ly t he k now n dr iver oncogene . CRISPRi , because it does not cut the genome , avoids this error mode but has a blind spot of its own : by virtue of repressing t rans cr ipt ion , w hen t argete d to bidire c t iona l promoters , CRISPRi c an si lence both genes 116 ; CRISPR a appro aches may have the s ame shor tc oming , alt houg h this has not been studied in detail . These sources of false p osit ives shou ld b e examined dur ing ana lysis of s cre en - ing results , for example , by looking for hit genes that cluster in nearby genomic locations , and further empha - siz e the va lue in examining a model system wit h mu ltiple p ertu r b ationa l te chnolog ies . Regardless of the perturbation used , one important limitat ion of p o ole d s cre ens is p aracr ine sig na l ling effects or other non - cell - autonomous roles of genes . For example , if a s ecrete d g rowt h f ac tor t hat is ess ent i a l for viability is knocked out of all cells in one well in an ar rayed assay , then the cells in t hat wel l wi ll die , and t hat gene wi ll s core . However , if t hat s ame g rowth factor is knocked out of a cell in a pooled population , as the other cells in that population have different genes knocked out , t he g rowth f ac tor w i ll st i l l b e pres ent in t he c u lture , and the importance of that gene will be missed . Thus , even a genome - wide screen will not necessarily identify all genes t hat are rele vant to a phenot yp e. Vali d at ing and ge ne ralizing re sults : diffe re nt cell s , dif - ferent answers . A common refrain is that the first step after the screen is to ‚validate™ the hits , a word that has several layers of meaning . First , the perturbation itself can be validated based on its technical reproducibility , which may or may not be necessary depending on t he qu alit y of the primary s creening data . S ec ond , t he tar - get of the perturbation can be validated to distinguish on - t arget ef fe c ts f rom of f - t arget ef fe c ts , w hich a ls o may or may not be strictly necessary , again depending on the quality of the primary data : indeed , we have seen s creens in which a ll sgRNAs targeting a gene sc ore at t he very top of a hit list 5 , 6 , 84 . On - target validation can include wester n blots to c onfir m loss of protein , but not a l l pro - teins will

have available antibodies . For CRISPR - ko s cre ens , desig ning PCR primers t hat amplif y across t he cut site and detecting indel formation by either endo- nuclease assays or direct sequencing can prove on - target activity 11 7 , whereas for CRISPRa and CRISPRi , quanti - tative reverse - transcription PCR ( qRT - PCR ) to examine RNA levels is an assay that scales well . Fundamentally , it is important to note that confirmation of on - target ac t iv it y does not r u le out t he possibi lit y t hat t he pheno - type is caused by an off - target effect . Here , it is critical to continue to perform phenotypic validation experiments with multiple sgRNAs per gene , not simply with the one s gRNA t hat gives t he most on - t arget ac t iv it y . A step beyond technical validation is to examine the extent to which the result generalizes to other biological contexts or is specific to the one screened . A geneŒphenotype relationship that does not extend to a different model is not necessarily evidence of a false positive finding . Rather , it is an observation that will require additional experiments to understand the differences across models , and it might even have valu - able applications , such as gene dependencies that occur on ly in c el ls t hat har b our p ar tic u l ar c anc er mut at ions . A simple example from the literature shows that it is common for results to vary across systems . The small molecule 6 - thioguanine , a purine analogue , and its target protein , hypoxanthine - guanine phosphoribosyl- transferase ( HPRT1 ) , have constituted a workhorse model of mammalian genetics for half a century 118 . In two studies using CRISPR - ko screens for resist - anc e to 6 - thiogu anine , one in human c el ls 6 and one in mou s e c el l s 7 , HPRT1 s c ored , as did mu lt iple memb ers of t he mismatch rep air pathway . However , another NATURE REVIEWS | GENETICS VOLUME 19 | FEBRUARY 2018 | 77 ß e  ’  ”  ‘ Ÿ e e e ¦ e e e e ¥ e e e ¥ Paralogues Two genes that are produced by a gene duplication event and that , owing to their shared sequence , may have the same or similar functions . Thus , loss of one of them is often insufficient to manifest a phenotype , as the other paralogue can compensate . CRISPR - ko study in different human cell lines 84 , as well as a gene trap screen in haploid human embryonic stem cells 119 , also found HPRT1 , but failed to identify mismatch repair pathway genes , instead identifying the gene NUDT5 , which functions biochemically upstream of HPRT1 in purine metabolism . These results demon - strate both the variability of cellular circuitry across cell types and the value of screening with multiple model systems . Reporting guidelines . Although most manuscripts that use screening technology tend to focus deeply on a small number of genes deemed to be interesting , the ability of readers to easily browse and reanalyse the data as a whole is an important contribution of the study . The onus is on aut hors , re v ie wers and e ditors to ensure that the screening data are appropriately documented and made available . In its most raw form , the output of pooled screens is unprocessed sequencing reads , which are often ( but not always ) uploaded to a central repository such as the Sequence Read Archive of the US National Center for Biotechnology Information ( NCBI ) . While in theory this allows anyone to fully repeat the analysis , for most users , this is too raw , as the steps required are multiple and time consuming . The user must download very large files , acquire and understand existing code to deconvolute the data or w rite s cripts to do so and organize t he d at a in a way t hat matches t he exp er iment a l and ana lyt ic a l f ramework of the original publication . This can easily be a full day™s work or more , especially if the user has not already gone t hroug h t his pro c ess many t imes˜b efore . When s equencing d at a are to b e us e d for ass embling genomes , ident if y ing rare a l leles or c al ling tumour mut a - tions , the details about

error rates and read lengths are critical , and thus reanalysis of the raw data is important . However , in genetic screens , sequencing is used solely as a means of counting sgRNAs . It would be far more applicable and useful for authors to provide such counts ; in a ll c as es t hes e c ounts are repres ente d in a simple text fi le that must a lready exist on their loca l hard drives . On the other hand , the data provided may be overly pro - c ess e d , such as w hen on ly gene - le vel d at a are g iven and information about individual sgRNAs is missing . In this case , numerous decisions have been set in stone by the authors , such as choices about how to combine replicate information and how to weight multiple sgRNAs tar - geting the same gene , and the details underlying these de cisions are lost in t he output d ata . Althoug h it is usefu l for authors to provide an authoritative take on their own d at a s et , as t he y k now it b est , f uture us ers of t he d at a shou ld not b e c onst raine d by t hes e choic es . Going forward ( and acknowledging that these guide - lines are suggested from experience , not from this author a lways fol low ing t hem c ompletely hims elf ) , it wou ld b e most useful if all pooled screening data were provided in each of three ways : first , raw sequencing reads on a public s er ver ; s ec ond , re ad c ounts prov ided as a supple - mentary text file ( not a PDF , as this hinders extraction and proc essing of t he d ata ) ; and t hird , gene s c ores of all genes , by the authors™ preferred perturbation - to - gene scoring scheme , rather than simply a table of top hits . Taking these steps will extend the reach of studies and deepen their impact , enabling mining of connections between genes and model systems that could not have been anticipated . A very useful resource in this regard is G enomeCRISPR , a brows able d at ab ase that c ol l ates d at a f rom published s cre ens 120 . Conclusions CRISPR technology has ushered in a new wave of optimism for our ability to functionally annotate the genome . For genetic screens , progress with CRISPR has been greatly accelerated by both the successes and t he less ons le ar ne d f rom earlier s cre ening te chnolog ies , most notably RNAi . Although the te chnology cont in - ues to de velop at a rapid pac e , t he exec ut ion of a genet ic screen relies on understanding fundamental principles and optimizing experimental steps that will remain c onst ant re gard less of t he exact p ertur b at ion . For example , combinatorial screens are beginning to b e come p ossible , w hich wi ll b e p art icu l arly power - ful in understanding paralogues and other functional redundancies that can prevent single - gene - perturbation s cre ens from unc over ing phenot yp es 121 Œ 123 . This may b e especially important when attempting to use genetic perturbations to uncover potential drug targets : while a small molecule will often be able to inhibit multiple paralogues so long as the binding sites are conserve d , t arget ing on ly a sing le gene w it h a genet ic p er tur bat ion will leave the pathway intact . Clear examples are the redundancies in the mitogen ac tivated protein kinase ( MAPK ) p at hway proteins , such as b et we en MEK1 and MEK2 and b et we en ERK1 and ERK2 . Addit iona l ly , t he ability to build genetic interaction maps has proved to be a powerful and unbiased approach to organizing the function of genes 124 , as has been comprehensively done in yeast 125 , 126 . For expanding to larger genomes , the number of geneŒgene c ombinat ions grows exp o - nent i a l ly Š test ing 20,000 genes p air wis e is 400 mi l lion combinations Š hence , this is an area where even one genome - w ide s creen wou ld b e a hercu le an effort and will certainly not be feasible on a routine basis . Thus , similar to the creation of custom pools when cell num - bers are limiting , screens in pairwise space will generally re quire fo c us e d inter rogat ion of c urate d gene˜s ets . Another exciting application for genetic screens is

dissect ing the mechanism of action of small molecules that score in phenotypic assays 40 , 12 7 , 128 . Cer tain ly , pro - teomic approaches will remain powerful and necessary for u lt imate ident if ic at ion of t he dire c t t arget of a sma l l molecule , but the relative ease of execution of genet ic screens can inform on the pathways involved by iden - t if y ing genes t hat , w hen modu l ate d , eit her s ensitiz e t he cells to the small molecule or lead to resistance . Here , because small molecule screens are performed in multi - wel l formats , the ass ay w i ll ne e d to be re c onfigure d to b e amenable to po ole d s cre ening ; for v i abi lit y s cre ens , t his is easily done , but for high - dimensional readouts such as imaging , finding and validating an appropriate surrogate t hat c an b e scre ene d in a po oled for mat may repres ent a c onsiderable cha l lenge . 78 | FEBRUARY 2018 | VOLUME 19 www.nature.com/nrg ß e  ’  ”  ‘ Ÿ e e e ¦ e e e e ¥ e e e ¥ CRISPR technology is one of the most exciting developments in biology this decade , and the fact that nearly any laboratory can approach this technology is one of its greatest strengths . Yet challenges in uptake remain . Most of the new approaches with CRISPR are developed in easy - to - use cell culture systems , and these advances do not always port seamlessly to more c omplex mo del systems . Li ke w is e , lent iv iral deliver y of perturbations to cells is still challenging in some cell types , and some cellular models are difficult to scale .
